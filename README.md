Regret and loss go hand in hand. 
Loss of something cues in regret, especially if you care about it. Even more if it's all of the work you've done so far, all the projects, animations, everything, gone suddenly. 
Nobody anticipates such a day, nobody wants this day to come ever. But alas, it comes, while you're alive or after your death, today or eons into the future. Gone forever.
Atleast github can save it for a while for someone who is wise. (Only fools create all their projects in local machines awaiting the time for their demise).

**Hello** from a *fool*
This is the space where all the future adventures will be saved for lifetime access(hopefully)
For many more projects, cool or not, and many more mistakes; many more wins and many more losses, much wisdom and much foolhardiness to come. 
Fearlessly onward,
Yours Truly
